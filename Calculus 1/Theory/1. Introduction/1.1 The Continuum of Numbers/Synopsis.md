- The positive or natural numbers $1,2,3,\dots$ are abstract symbols for indicating "how many" objects there are in a collection or set of discrete elements
- These symbols are stripped of all reference to the concrete qualities of the objects counted.

- The profound need for expressing measures of quantities in terms of what we would like to call numbers forces us to extend the number concept so that we may describe a continuous gradation of measures -> number continuum or system of "real numbers"
