# The Natural and the Rational Numbers
- The inverse operations, subtraction and division are not always possible within the set of natural numbers. -> extend the concept of number by inventing the number $0$, the "negative" integers and fraction -> rational numbers.
- A rational number can always be written in the from $\frac p q$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \not = 0$. We can make this presentation unique by requiring that $q$ is positive and that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor larger than 1.
# Graphical Representation of Rational Numbers
- Usually represented graphically by:
	- Points on a straight line $L$, the number axis. Taking an arbitrary point of $L$ as the origin or point $0$ and another arbitrary point as the point $1$ -> distance between these 2 points to serve as a scale or unit of measurement and define the direction from $0$ to $1$ as "positive"
	- $$|x| = \begin{cases} x, &\text{if x is positive or 0} \\ -x , & \text{if x is negative} \end{cases}$$ , note that $|x|$ is never negative and equals zero only when $x=0$
	- Open interval: $(a,b) \iff a < x<b$
	- Closed interval: $[a,b] \iff a \le x \le b$
	- In either case the *length of the interval* is $b-a$ 
# Density
- The arbitrary closeness of rational points to a given point $P$ of $L$ is expressed by saying:
	- The rational points are dense on the number axis => Between 2 distinct rational points $a$ and $b$, there are infinitely many other rational points 
# Incommensurable
