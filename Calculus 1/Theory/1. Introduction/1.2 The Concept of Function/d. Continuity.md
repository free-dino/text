# Intuitive and Precise Explanation:
$$
f(x) = \text{sgn}(x) = \begin{cases} 
+1 & \text{if } x >0 \\
0 & \text{if } x =0 \\
-1 & \text{if } x< 0
\end{cases}
$$

- The function $f(x)$ is continuous at a point $x_0$ of its domain if for every positive $\epsilon$ we can find a positive number $\delta$ such that $$|f(x) -f(x_0)|<\epsilon$$ for all values $x$ in the domain of $f$ for which $|x-x_0| < \delta$  
# Modulus of Continuity, Uniform Continuity

# Lipschitz-Continuity and HÃ¶lder Continuity 
- Lipschitz continuous functions: the functions $f(x)$ which satisfy an inequality of the form: $$|f(x_2) -f(x_1) \le |x_2-x_1|$$ for all $x_1, x_2$ in the interval with a fixed value $L$
