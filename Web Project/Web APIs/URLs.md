A URL is the address of a resource on the internet. for example https://www.google.com

If we type the full URL address into a web browser:
- The browser sends a request out over the internet and connect to a server that responds with the data needed to render the Google homepage in your browser
- This request and response pattern is the basis of all web communication.
- A client requests information and a server responds with response
- Since web communication occurs via [[World Wide Web#^0917a2|HTTP]] these are known more formally as HTTP requests and HTTP responses

Every URL like https://python.org/about/ has 3 potent parts:
- a scheme - https
- a hostname - www.python.org
- an (optional) path -/about/
