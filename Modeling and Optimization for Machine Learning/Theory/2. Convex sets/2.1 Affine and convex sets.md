# 2.1.1 Lines and line segments
Suppose $\v x_1 \not = \v x_2$ are 2 points in $\R^n$. Points of the form
$$
y = \theta \v x_1 + (1-\theta)\v x_2
$$
where $\theta \in \R$, form the line passing through $\v x_1$ and $\v x_2$.
Values of the parameter $\theta$ between $0$ and $1$ correspond to the line segment between $\v x_1$ and $\v x_2$

Expressing $y$ in the form 
$$
y = \v x_2 + \theta(\v x_1 - \v x_2)
$$
gives another interpretation: $y$ is the sum of the base point $\v x_2$ (corresponding to $\theta = 0$) and the direction $\v x_1 - \v x_2$ (point from $\v x_2$ to $\v x_1$) scaled by the parameter $\theta$.

# 2.1.2 Affine sets
A set $C \subseteq \R^n$ is [[Affine space|affine]] if the line through any two distinct points in $C$ lies in $C$, i.e., if for any $\v x_1, \v x_2 \in C$ and $\theta \in \R$, we have $\theta \v x_1 + (1-\theta)\v x_2 \in C$. 

We refer to a point of the form $\theta_1 \v x_1 + \cdots + \theta_k \v x_k$ where $\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i =1$ as an affine combination of the points $\v x_1, \dots, \v x_k$.

If $C$ is an affine set and $\v x_0 \in \C$, then the set
$$
V = C - \v x_0 = \{\v x-\v x_0 \mid \v x \in C\}
$$
is a subspace, i.e., closed under sums and scalar multiplication.

(Proof):
Suppose $\v v_1, \v v_2 \in V$ and $\a, \b \in \R$. Then we have $\v v_1 + \v x_0 \in C$ and $\v v_2 + \v x_0 \in C$, and so
$$
\a \v v_1 + \b \v v_2 + \v x_0 = \a (\v v_1 + \v x_0) + \b(\v x_2 + \v x_0) + (1-\a-\b)\v x_0 \in C
$$
since $C$ is affine, and $\a + \b + (1-\a-\b) = 1$. We conclude that $\a \v v_1 + \b \v v_2 \in V$ since $\a \v v_1 + \b \v v_2 + \v x_0 \in C$.
Thus, the affine set $C$ can be expressed as
$$
C = V + \v x_0 = \{ \v v+ \v x_0 \mid \v v \in V\}
$$
=> a subspace plus an offset.

=> The dimension of an affine set $C$ as the dimension of the subspace $V = C -\v x_0$

The set of all affine combinations of points in some set $C \subseteq \R^n$ is called the affine hull of $C$, and denoted $\textbf{aff } C$: ^857c3c
$$
\textbf{aff } C = \{\theta_1 \v x_1 + \cdots + \theta_k + \v x_k \mid \v x_1 , \dots , \v x_k \in C , \theta_1 + \cdots + \theta_k = 1 \}
$$
The affine hull is the smallest affine set that contains $C$, in the following sense: if any $S$ is any affine set with $C \subseteq S$, then $\textbf{aff } C\subseteq S$.
# 2.1.3 Affine dimension and relative interior
We define the affine dimension of a set $C$ as the dimension of its [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^857c3c|affine hull]]
The affine dimension of a set $C \subseteq \R^n$ is less than $n$, then the set lies in the affine set $\textbf{aff } C \not = \R^n$. We define the relative interior of the set $C$, denoted $$\textbf{relint } C = \{ \v x \in C \mid B(\v x, r) \cap \textbf{aff } C \subseteq C \text{ for some } r>0 \}$$
where $B(\v x, r) = \{\v y \mid \norm{\v y-\v x} \leq r \}$, the ball of radius $r$ and center $\v x$ in the norm $\norm{\cdot}$.
We can then define relative boundary of a set $C$ as $\textbf{cl } C \setminus \textbf{relint } C$ where $\textbf{cl } C$ is the closure of $C$.
