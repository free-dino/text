Some simple examples:
- The empty set $\emptyset$, any single point $\{\v x_0 \}$, and the whole space $\R^n$ are [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^ffbbe1|affine]] (hence, [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^ffc64f|convex]]) subsets of $\R^n$
- Any line is affine. If it passes through zero, it's a subspace, hence also a [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^e50dd7|convex cone]].
- A [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^19d525|line segment]] is convex, but not affine (unless it reduces to a point)
- A ray, which has the form $\v x_0 + \theta \v x \mid \theta \ge 0$, where $v \not = 0$, is convex, but not affine. It's a convex cone if its base $\v x_0$ is $0$
- Any subspace is affine, and a convex cone (hence convex)

# 2.2.1 Hyperplanes and halfspaces

A hyperplane is a [[1.1 Sets#^072bfe|set]] of the form: $$\{\v x \mid \v a^\top \v x = b \}$$ where $\v a \in \R^n$, $\v a \not = 0$, and $b \in \R$.

Geometrically: set of points with a constant inner product to a given vector $\v a$, or a hyperplane with normal vector $\v a$; the constant $b \in \R$ determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin.

Express the geometric interpretation in this form: $$\{\v x \mid \v a^\top (\v x - \v x_0)=0\}$$
where $\v x_0$ is any point in the hyperplane (i.e., any point that satisfies $\v a^\top \v x_0=b$). This presentation can in turn be expressed as: 
$$
\set{\v x \mid \v a ^\top(\v x - \v x_0)=0}=\v x_0 + \v a^\bot
$$
where $\v a^\bot$ denotes the orthogonal complement of $\v a$, i.e., the set of all vectors orthogonal to it: $$\v a^\bot = \set{\v v \mid \v a^\top \v v=0}$$
This shows that the hyperplane consists of an offset $\v x_0$, plus all vectors orthogonal to the (normal) vector $\v a$.

A hyperplane divides $\R^n$ into 2 halfspace. A (closed) halfspace is a set of the form: $$\set{\v x \mid \v a^\top \v x \le b},$$where $\v a \not = 0$, i.e., the solution set of one (nontrivial) linear inequality. Halfspace are convex, but not affine.
![[Pasted image 20250121071057.png]]
The halfspace can also be expressed as$$\set{\v x \mid \v a^\top (\v x - \v x_0)}$$where $\v x_0$ is any point on the associated hyperplane, i.e., satisfies $\v a^\top \v x_0=b$.
![[Pasted image 20250121071417.png]]
The boundary of the halfspace is the hyperplane $\set{\v x \mid \v a^\top \v x = b}$. The set $\set{\v x \mid \v a^\top \v x < b}$, which is the interior of the halfspace $\set{\v x \mid \v a^\top \v x \le b}$, is called an open halfspace. ^1d15fe

# Euclidean balls and ellopsoids
A (Euclidean) ball (or just ball) in $\R^n$ has the form
$$B(\v x_c, r)= \set{\v x \mid \norm{\v x-\v x_c}_2 \le r}=\set{\v x \mid  (\v x - \v x_c)^\top(\v x - \v x_c) \le r^2}$$
where $r>0$, and $\norm{\cdot}_2$ denotes the Euclidean norm, i.e., $\norm{\v u}_2 = (\v u^\top \v u)^\frac{1}{2}$.
The vector $\v x_c$ is the center of the ball
The scalar $r$ is the radius of the ball.
Another common representation for the Euclidean ball is: ^a8aef3
$$
B(\v x_c , r) = \set{\v x_c + r \v u \mid \norm {\v u}_2 \le 1}
$$
A Euclidean ball is a [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^ffc64f|convex set]]:

If $\norm{\v x_1 - \v x_c}_2 \le r$, $\norm{\v x_2 - \v x_c} \le r$, and $0\le\theta\le 1$, then:
$$
\begin{align}
\norm{\theta \v x_1 + (1-\theta)\v x_2- \v x_c}_2 &= \norm{\theta(\v x_1 - \v x_c) + (1-\theta)(\v x_2 - \v x_c)}_2 \\
\end{align}
$$
With the [[Norms#^fec381|homogeneity property]] and [[Norms#^2e636a|triangle inequality]] for $\norm{\cdot}_2$, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
\norm{\theta(\v x_1 - \v x_c)+(1-\theta)(\v x_2 - \v x_c)}_2 \le \theta \norm{\v x_1 - \v x_c}_2 +(1-\theta)\norm{\v x_2 - \v x_c}_2
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
& \theta \norm{\v x_1 - \v x_c}_2 \le \theta r \\
\implies \quad +  & \qquad\\
&(1-\theta) \norm{\v x_2 - \v x_c}_2 \le (1-\theta) r\\
&\text{\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_} \\
&\theta \norm{\v x_1 - \v x_c}_2 +(1-\theta)\norm{\v x_2 - \v x_c}_2 \le r
\end{align}
$$
$$
\iff \norm{\theta \v x_1 + (1-\theta)\v x_2}_2 \le r
$$

A related family of convex sets is the ellipsoids, which have the form:
$$
\mathcal E =\set{\v x \mid (\v x - \v x_c)^\top \mat P^{-1} (\v x -\v x_c) \le 1}
$$

^f34d70

where $\mat P = \mat P^\top â‰» 0$, i.e., $\mat P$ is symmetric and positive definite. 
The vector $\v x_c \in \R^n$ is the center of the ellipsoid. 
The matrix $\mat P$ determines how far the ellipsoid extends in every direction from $\v x_c$; 
The length of the semi-axes of $\mathcal E$ are given by $\sqrt{\ld_i}$ where $\ld_i$ are the eigenvalues of $\mat P$.

A [[2.2 Some important examples#^a8aef3|ball]] is an ellipsoid with $\mat P = r^2 \mat I$. 
![[Pasted image 20250121120451.png]]

Another common representation of an ellipsoid is:
$$
\mathcal E = \set{\v x_c + \mat A \v u \mid \norm {\v u}_2 \le 1},
$$
where $\mat A$ is square and nonsingular.

We can assume without loss of generality that $A$ is symmetric and positive definite.
By taking $\mat A = \mat P^\frac{1}{2}$, this representation gives the ellipsoid define in [[2.2 Some important examples#^f34d70|here]].
When the matrix $\mat A$ is symmetric positive semidefinite but singular, the set is called a degenerate ellipsoid; its affine dimension is equal to the rank of $\mat A$. Degenerate ellipsoids are also convex
# 2.2.3 Norm balls and norm cones
Suppose $\norm \cdot$ is any norm on $\R^n$, a norm ball of radius $r$ and center $\v x_c$, given by $\set{x \mid \norm {\v x - \v x_c} \le r}$, is convex.

The norm cone associated with the norm $\norm \cdot$ is the set:
$$
C = \set{(x,t) \mid \norm x \le t} \subseteq \R^{n+1}
$$
It's a convex [[2.1 Affine and convex sets#^e50dd7|cone]].
# 2.2.4 Polyhedra
A polyhedron is defined as a solution set of a finite number of linear equalities and inequalities: $$\mathcal P = \{ \v x \mid  \v a_j^\top \v x\le b_j, j = 1,\dots,m, \quad \v c_j^\top \v x = \v d_j, \quad j=1,\dots,p\}$$A polyhedron is thus the intersection of a finite number of halfspace and hyperplanes. 
Affine sets, rays, line segments, and halfspaces are all polyhedra.

![[Pasted image 20250122215726.png]]

It will be convenient to use the compact notation: 
$$
\mathcal P = \set {\v x \mid \mat A \v x \preceq b, \mat C \v x = d 
}
$$
where:
$$
\mat A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\v a^\top_1 \\
\vdots \\
\v a^\top_m
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad 
\mat C = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\v c^\top_1 \\
\vdots \\
\v c^\top_p
\end{bmatrix},
$$
and the symbol $\preceq$ denotes vector inequality or component-wise inequality in $\R^m$
