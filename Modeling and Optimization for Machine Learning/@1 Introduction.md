# 1.2 Structured probabilistic models
$\qquad$Complex system are characterized by the presence of multiple interrelated aspect, many of which related to the reasoning task. These domains can be characterized in terms of a set of random variables, where the value of each variable defines an important property of the world.
$\qquad$ Our task is to reason probabilistically about the values of one or more of the variables, possibly given observations about some others. In order to do so using principled probabilistic reasoning, we need to construct a *joint distribution* over the space of possible assignments to some set of random variables $\chi$
