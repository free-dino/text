According to the [[5.2 The weak law of large numbers|weak law of large numbers]], the distribution of the sample mean $M_n = (X_1 + \cdots + X_n)/n$ is go to true mean $\mu$, variance go to $0$.

The variance of the sum: $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n = nM_n$ increase to infinity, and the distribution of $S_n$ cannot be said to anything meaningful.

Considering the deviation $S_n - n\mu$ of $S_n$ from its mean $n \mu$, and scaling it by a factor proportional to $1/\sqrt n$ -> keeps the variance at a constant level.

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots$ be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. We define:
$$
Z_n = \frac{S_n - n \mu}{\sigma \sqrt n} = \frac {X_1 + \cdots + X_n - n \mu}{\sigma \sqrt n}
$$
An easy calculation yields
$$
\E[Z_n] = \frac {\E[X_1 + \cdots + X_n] - n_\mu}{\sigma \sqrt n} = 0
$$
and 

$$
\text{Var}(Z_n) = \frac{\text{Var}(X_1 + \cdots + X_n)}{\sigma^2 n} = \frac {\text{Var}(X_1) + \cdots + \text{Var}(X_n)}{\sigma^2 n} = 1
$$
