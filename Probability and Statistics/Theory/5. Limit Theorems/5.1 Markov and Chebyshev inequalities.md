## Markov inequality:
If a nonnegative random variable has a small mean, then the probability that it takes a large value must also be small.

> **Markov Inequality**
> If a random variable $X$ can only take nonnegative values, then $$\mathbf P(X \ge a) \le \frac{\E[X]}{a}, \qquad \forall a > 0$$

## Chebyshev Inequality

^1e36b3

If a random variable has small variance, then the probability that it takes a value far from its mean is also small. (Does not require the random variable to be nonnegative)

> **Chebyshev Inequality**
> If $X$ is a random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then $$\mathbf P(|X-\mu| \ge c) \le \frac{\sigma^2}{c^2}, \qquad \forall c>0$$
> An alternative form: Letting $c = k\sigma$, where $k>0$, which yields $$\mathbf P(|X-\mu| \ge k\sigma) \le \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2 \sigma^2} = \frac{1}{k^2}$$
> -> the probability that a random variable takes a value more than $k$ standard deviation away from its mean is at most $\frac 1 {k^2}$

The Chebyshev inequality tends to be more powerful than the Markov inequality
