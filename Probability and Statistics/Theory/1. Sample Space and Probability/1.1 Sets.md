A set is a collection of objects, which are the elements of the set. ^072bfe

If $\mathcal S$ is a set and $x$ is an element of $\s S$, we write $x \in \s S$.
If $x$ is not an element of $\s S$, we write $x \not \in \s S$.
If the set have no elements, we call it the empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$.

Countably finite:
$$
\s S = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}
$$
Countably infinite:
$$
\s S = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots\}
$$
If all $x$ have a certain property $P$, and denote it by: $$ \{x \mid x \text{ satisfies } P\}$$The symbol "$\mid$" is to be read as "such that" 

If the elements of a set cannot be written down in a list, such a set is said to be uncountable.

If every element of set $\s S$ is also an element of a set $\s T$, we say that $\s S$ is a subset of $\s T$ denoted as $\s S \subset \s T$ or $\s T \supset \s S$

If $\s S \subset T$ and $\s T \subset \s S$, the two sets are equal, we write $\s S = \s T$

Universal set, denoted by $\Omega$, which contains all objects that could conceivably be of interest in a particular context. 

# Set operations
The complement of a set $\s S$, with respect to the universe $\Omega$, is the set $\set{x \in \Omega \mid x \not \in \s S}$ and it denoted by $\s S^c$. Note that $\Omega^c = \emptyset$ 

The union: $$\s S \cup \s T = \set{x \mid x \in \s S \text{ or } x \in \s T}$$
The intersection: $$\s S \cap \s T = \set{x \mid x \in \s S \text{ and } x \in \s T}$$

We also have:
$$
\begin{equation}
\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \s S_n =  \s S_1 \cup \s S_2 \cup \cdots = \set{x \mid x \in \s S_n \text{ for some } n}
\end{equation}
$$
and 
$$
\begin{equation}
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \s S_n =  \s S_1 \cap \s S_2 \cap \cdots = \set{x \mid x \in \s S_n \text{ for all } n}
\end{equation}
$$

Two sets are said to be disjoint if their intersection is empty. More generally, several sets are said to be disjoint if no two of them have a common element

A collection of sets is said to be a partition of a set $\s S$ if the sets in the collection are disjoint and their union is $\s S$ 

# The Algebra of Sets
Elementary consequences of the definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
\s S \cup \s T &= \s T \cup \s S \\
\s S \cap  (\s T \cup \s U) & = (\s S \cap \s T) \cup (\s S \cap \s U)
\end{align}
