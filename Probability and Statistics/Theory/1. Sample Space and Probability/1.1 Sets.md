A set is a collection of objects, which are the elements of the set. ^072bfe

If $S$ is a set and $x$ is an element of $S$, we write $x \in S$.
If $x$ is not an element of $S$, we write $x \not \in S$.
If the set have no elements, we call it the empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$.

Countably finite:
$$
S = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}
$$
Countably infinite:
$$
S = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots\}
$$
If all $x$ have a certain property $P$, and denote it by:
$$
\{x \mid x \text{ satisfies } P\}
$$
