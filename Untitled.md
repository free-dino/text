\subsection{Implications for DICOM-to-BIDS conversion}  
The challenges discussed above have direct consequences for conversion tools and motivate several key features in our GUI. First, anonymization must be configurable and auditable, allowing the removal or replacement of personally identifiable information while preserving essential linking identifiers. Because vendors use private tags and proprietary encodings, the tool must incorporate vendor-aware parsing with mappings and fallback rules. It also needs flexible frame handling to correctly detect and expand or collapse multi-frame objects and stacks of single-frame files. In addition, robust compression support is required, relying on reliable decoding libraries such as \texttt{dcm2niix} and providing clear error reporting when unsupported transfer syntaxes are encountered. Finally, due to protocol drift and inconsistent naming conventions, interactive series mapping is necessary so that users can visually inspect and adjust automatic series-to-BIDS mappings.
