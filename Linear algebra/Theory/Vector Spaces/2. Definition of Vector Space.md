The motivation for the definition of a vector space comes from properties of addition and scalar multiplication in $\mathbb F^n$:
* Addition is [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^73df23|commutative]], [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^b1e9b9| associative]], and has an [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^2fc3b4|identity]].
* Every element has an [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^70226f|additive inverse]].
* Scalar multiplication is [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^b1e9b9|associative]]

# Definition: Addition, Scalar multiplication
- An addition on a set $V$ is a function that assigns and element $u+v \in V$ to each pair of element $u, v \in V$.
- A [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^009b28|scalar]] multiplication on a set $V$ is a function that assigns an element $\ld v \in V$ to each $\ld \in \mathbb F$ and each $v \in V$
# Definition: vector space
- A vector space is a set $V$ along with an addition on $V$ and a scalar multiplication on $V$ such that the following properties hold.
	- Commutativity $$u+v = v+u \qquad \forall u, v \in V$$
	- Associativity $$(u+v)+w = u + (v+w) \text{ and } (ab)v = a(bv) \ \forall u,v,w \in V \text{ and } \forall a,b \in \mathbb F$$
	- Additive identity: $$\exists 0 \in V : v + 0 = v \quad \forall v \in V$$
	- Additive inverse: $$\forall v \in V, \exists w \in V: v + w =0$$
	- Multiplicative identity: $$1v = v \quad \forall v \in V$$
	- Distributive properties: $$a(u+v) = au+av \text{ and } (a+b)v = av + bv \quad \forall a,b \in \mathbb F \text{ and } u, v \in V$$
# Definition: vector, point
- Elements of a vector space are called vectors or points.
# Definition: Real vector space, complex vector space
- A vector space over $\R$ is called a real vector space
- A vector space over $\C$ is called a complex vector space
The simplest vector space is $\{0\}$, which contains only one point
# Notation: $\mathbb F^S$
* If $S$ is a set, then $\mathbb F^S$ denotes the set of functions from $S$ to $\mathbb F$.
- For $f, g \in \mathbb F^S$, the sum $f+g \in \mathbb F^S$ is the function defined by $$(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) \quad \forall x \in S$$
- For $\ld \in \mathbb F$ and $f \in \mathbb F^S$, the product $\ld f \in \mathbb F^S$ is the function defined by $$(\ld f) (x) = \ld f(x) \quad \forall x \in S$$
# Unique additive identity
- A vector space has a unique additive identity
# Unique additive inverse
- Every element in a vector space has a unique additive inverse
# Notation: $-v, w - v$
Let $v, w \in V$. Then
- $-v$ denotes the additive inverse of $v$;
- $w-v$ is defined to be $w + (-v)$
# Notation: $V$
- For the rest of this book, $V$ denotes a vector space over $\mathbb F$.
# The number $0$ times a vector
$0v = 0 \quad \forall v \in V$
# A number times the vector $0$
$a0 = 0 \quad \forall a \in \mathbb F$
# The number $-1$ times a vector
$(-1)v = -v \quad \forall v \in V$
