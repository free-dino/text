The motivation for the definition of a vector space comes from properties of addition and scalar multiplication in $\mathbb F^n$:
* Addition is [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^73df23|commutative]], [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^b1e9b9| associative]], and has an [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^2fc3b4|identity]].
* Every element has an [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^70226f|additive inverse]].
* Scalar multiplication is [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^b1e9b9|associative]]
* 
## Definition: Addition, Scalar multiplication
- An addition on a set $V$ is a function that assigns and element $u+v \in V$ to each pair of element $u, v \in V$.
- A [[1. Real space and Complex Space#^009b28|scalar]] multiplication on a set $V$ is a function that assigns an element $\ld v \in V$ to each $\ld \in \mathbb F$ and each $v \in V$
## Definition: vector space
- A vector space is a set $V$ along with an addition on $V$ and a scalar multiplication on $V$ such that the following properties hold.
	- Commutativity $$u+v = v+u \qquad \forall u, v \in V$$
	- Associativity $$(u+v)+w = $$
