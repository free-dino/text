## Complex numbers
### 1. Definition complex numbers: $\mathbb C$

^881fa0

- A complex number is an ordered pair $(a,b)$, where $a, b \in \mathbb R$ but we will write this as $a+bi$
- The set of all complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb C$: $$\mathbb C = \{a+bi \mid a, b \in \mathbb R\}$$
- Addition and multiplication on $\mathbb C$ are defined by $$(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i,$$$$(a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i;$$ here $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb R$
$\R$ is a subset of $\C$ 

### 2. Properties of complex arithmetic

^770ab7

- **Commutativity**:
  $\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha$ and $\alpha \beta = \beta \alpha$, $\forall \alpha, \beta \in \C$
  [[Properties of complex arithmetic#^da644a|Proof]] ^73df23
- **Associativity**:
  $(\alpha + \beta)+ \lambda = \alpha + (\beta + \lambda)$ and $(\alpha \beta)\lambda = \alpha(\beta\lambda)$, $\forall \alpha, \beta, \lambda \in \C$
  [[Properties of complex arithmetic#^10ce7f|proof]] ^b1e9b9
- **Identities**:
  $\ld + 0 = \ld$ and $\ld \cdot 1 = \ld$, $\forall \ld \in \C$  
  [[Properties of complex arithmetic#^12d8d0|proof]] ^2fc3b4
- **Additive inverse**:
  For every $\a \in \C$, there exists a unique $\b \in \C$ such that $\a + \b = 0$
  [[Properties of complex arithmetic#^3c5509|proof]] ^70226f
- **Multiplicative inverse**:
  For every $\a \in \C$ with $\a \not = 0$, there exists a unique $\b \in C$ such that $\a \cdot \b = 1$
  [[Properties of complex arithmetic#^418982|proof]]
- **Distributive property**:
  $\ld(\a + \b) = \ld \a + \ld \b$,   $\forall \ld, \a, \b \in \C$ 
  [[Properties of complex arithmetic#^512305|proof]] 

### 3. Definition: $-\a$, subtraction, $1/\a$, division
Suppose $\a, \b \in \C$
- Let $-\a$ denote the additive inverse of $\a$. Thus $-\a$ is the unique complex number such that:$$ \a + (-\a) = 0$$
- *Subtraction* on $\C$ is defined by: $$\b - \a = \b + (-\a)$$
- For $\a \not = 0$, let $1/\a$ and $\frac 1 \a$ denote the multiplicative inverse of $\a$. Thus $1/\a$ is the unique complex number such that: $$\a (1/\a)=1$$
- For $\a \not = 0$, division by $\a$ is defined by: $$\b/\a = \b(1/\a)$$
### 4. Notation $\mathbb F$ 
- $\mathbb F$ stands for either $\R$ or $\C$
- Elements of $\mathbb F$ is called *scalar* ^009b28
- For $\a \in \mathbb F$ and $m \in \mathbb N^+$: $$\a^m = \underbrace{\a \dots \a}_{m\text{ times}}$$ $$\implies (\a^m)^n = \a^{mn} \qquad \text{and} \qquad (\a\b)^m = \a^m \b^m$$ $\forall \a, \b \in \mathbb F$ 
### 5. Definition: list, length
- Suppose $n \in \mathbb N^*$. A list of length $n$ is an ordered collection of $n$ elements (many mathematicians call it an $n$-tuple) ^445a0c
- 2 lists are equal $\iff$ they have the same length and the same elements in the same order

A list of length 0: $()$ 

> [!Compare] Lists vs Sets
> In lists, order matters and repetitions have meaning; in sets, order and repetitions are irrelevant

## $\mathbb F^n$
### 1. Notation: n
- Fix a positive integer $n$ for the rest of this chapter
### 2. Definition: $\mathbb F^n$, coordinate
- $\mathbb F^n$ is the set of all [[#^445a0c|lists]] of length $n$ of elements of $\mathbb F$:$$\mathbb F^n = \{(x_1, \dots, x_n) \mid x_k \in \mathbb F \text{ for } k= 1, \dots, n\}$$
- For $(x_1,\dots, x_n) \in \mathbb F^n$ and $k\in \{1, \dots, n\}$, we say that $x_k$ is the $k^{th}$ coordinate of $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$
### 3. Definition: Addition in $\mathbb F^n$

^05bcba

- Addition in $\mathbb F^n$ is defined by adding corresponding coordinates:$$(x_1,\dots, x_n) + (y_1,\dots,y_n) = (x_1+y_1, \dots, x_n + y_n)$$
### 4. Commutativity of addition in $\mathbb F^n$
- If $x, y \in \mathbb F^n$ then $x+y = y+x$
  [[Commutativity of addition in F-n|proof]]
### 5. Notation: 0
* Let 0 denote the list of length $n$ whose coordinates are all 0: $$0 = (0,\dots, 0)$$
### 6. Additive inverse in $\mathbb F^n, -x$
- For $x \in \mathbb F^n$, the additive inverse of $x$, denoted by $-x$, is the vector $-x \in \mathbb F^n$ such that $$x+(-x)=0$$ Thus if $x=(x_1,\dots, x_2)$, then $-x=(-x_1,\dots, -x_n)$.
### 7. Scalar multiplication in $\mathbb F^n$
- The product of a number $\ld$ and a vector $\mathbb F^n$ is computed by multiplying each coordinate of the vector by $\ld$: $$\ld(x_1,\dots, x_n) = (\ld x_1, \dots,\lambda x_n)$$ here $\ld \in \mathbb F$ and $(x_1,\dots, x_n) \in \mathbb F^n$ 
## Digression on Fields
- A field is a set containing at least 2 distinct element called $0$ and $1$, along with operations of addition and multiplication satisfying all properties listed in [[#^770ab7|here]]. $\implies$ $\R$ and $\C$ are fields. The set $\{0,1\}$ with $1+1 \overset{\D}{=} 0$ is a field.
