# Functions

> [!NOTE] Definition
> A **function** $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $\mathcal D$ exact one element, called $f(x)$, in a set $\mathcal E$

- The set $\mathcal D$ is called the **domain** of the functions
- The number $f(x)$ is the **value of $f$ at $x$** and is read "$f$ of $x$"
- The **range** of $f$ is a set of all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout the domain. 

If $f$ is a function with domain $\mathcal D$, then its **graph** is the set of ordered pairs $$\set{(x, f(x) \mid x \in \mathcal D)}$$
In calculus, the most common method of defining a function is by an algebraic equation.

> [!NOTE] The Difference quotient
> $$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.$$ It represent the average rate of change of $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=a+h$
# Representations of Functions
- Verbally           (by a description in words)
- Numerically     (by a table of values)
- Visually            (by a graph)
- Algebraically    (by an explicit formula)

If a function is given by a formula and the domain is not stated explicitly, we use the following **domain convention**: 

> [!NOTE] Domain convention
> The domain of the function is the set of all inputs for which the formula make sense and gives a real-number output
# Which Rules Define Functions? 

> [!NOTE] The Vertical Line Test
> A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once

# Piecewise Defined Functions
The functions defined by different formulas in different parts of their domains are called **piecewise defined functions**

# Even and Odd Functions
- If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ $\forall x \in \mathcal D$, then $f$ is called an even function. Its graph is symmetric with respect to the $y-$axis
- If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ $\forall x \in \mathcal D$, then $f$ is called an odd function. Its graph is symmetric about the origin

# Increasing and Decreasing Functions

> [!NOTE] Increasing and Decreasing Functions
> A function $f$ is called increasing of an interval $I$ if $$f(x_1) < f(x_2) \qquad \text{whenever } x_1 < x_2 \text{ in } I$$ 
> It is called a **decreasing** on $I$ if $$f(x_1) > f(x_2) \qquad \text{whenever } x_1 < x_2 \text{ in } I$$
