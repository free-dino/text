# Functions

> [!Def] Function
> A **function** $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a [[1.1 Sets|set]] $\s D$ exactly one element, called $f(x)$, in a set $\s E$ 

We usually consider functions for which the sets $\s D$ and $\s E$ are sets of real numbers.
The set $\s D(f)$ is called the **domain** of a function $f$.
The number $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at $x$ and is read "$f$ of $x$".
The **range** of $f$, $\s R(f)$, is the set of all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout the domain
$y=f(x)$, $x$ is called the independent variable, $y$ is called the dependent variable.

> [!Def] Domain convention
> The domain of the function is the set of all inputs for which the formula makes sense and gives a real-number output

> [!Def] Graph
> If $f$ is a function with domain $\s D$, then its graph is the set of ordered pairs: $$\set{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in \s D}$$

# Representations of Functions
- Verbally (by a description in words)
- Numerically (by a table of value)
- Visually (by a graph)
- Algebraically (by an explicit formula)

# Which Rules Define Functions?

> [!Def] The Vertical Line Test
> A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

# Piecewise Defined Functions

> [!Def] Piecewise Defined Functions
> The functions are defined by different formulas in different parts of their domain

Absolute value is also a piecewise defined function: $$\begin{cases} |a| = a & \text{if } a \ge 0 \\ |a| = -a & \text{if } a <0\end{cases}$$ Remember that if $a$ is negative, then $-a$ is positive

# Even and Odd Functions


> [!Def] Even and Odd Function
> **Even function:** $f(-x) = f(x)$
> **Odd function**: $f(-x)=-f(x)$

# Increasing and Decreasing Functions

> [!Def] Increasing and Decreasing Functions
> A function $f$ is **increasing** on an interval $\s I$ if: $$f(x_1)<f(x_2) \qquad \text{whenever } x_1 < x_2 \text{ in } \s I$$
> 
> A function $f$ is **decreasing** on an interval $\s I$ if: $$f(x_1)>f(x_2) \qquad \text{whenever } x_1 < x_2 \text{ in } \s I$$
