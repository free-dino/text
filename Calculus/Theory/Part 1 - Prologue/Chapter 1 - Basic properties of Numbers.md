> [!NOTE] Property 1: Associative law for addition
> If $a, b,$ and $c$ are any numbers, then $$a+(b+c) = (a+b) + c$$

> [!NOTE] Property 2: Existence of an additive identity
> If $a$ is any number, then $$a+0 = 0 + a = a$$

> [!NOTE] Property 3: Existence of additive inverses
> For every number $a$, there is a number $-a$ such that $$a+(-a) = (-a) + a = 0$$

> [!NOTE] Property 4: Commutative law for addition
> If $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then $$a + b = b+ a$$

> [!NOTE] Property 5: Associative law for multiplication
> If $a, b,$ and $c$ are any numbers, then $$a \cdot(b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$$

> [!NOTE] Property 6: Existence of a multiplicative identity
> If $a$ is any number, then $$a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$$ Moreover $1 \not = 0$

> [!NOTE] Property 7: Existence of a multiplicative identity
> For every number $a \not = 0$, there is a number $a^{-1}$ such that $$a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1$$

> [!NOTE] Property 8: Communicative law for mutiplication
> If $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then $$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$$

> [!NOTE] Property 9: Distributive law
> If $a, b,$ and $c$ are any number, then $$a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$$

It's convenient to consider the collection of all positive numbers, denoted by $\mathbb P$ as a basic concept, and state all the properties in terms of $\mathbb P$ 

> [!NOTE] Property 10: Trichotomy law: 
> For every number $a$, one and only one of the following holds:
>-  (i)$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a=0$,
>-  (ii)$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ a$ is in the collection $P$,
>- (iii) $\ \ \ \ \ \ -a$ is in the collection $P$
