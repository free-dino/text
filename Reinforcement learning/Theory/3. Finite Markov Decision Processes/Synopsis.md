This problem involves evaluative feedback, as in [[2.1 A k-armed Bandit Problem|bandits]], but also an associative aspect - choosing different actions in different situations.

MDPs are a classical formalization of sequential decision making, where the actions influence not just immediate rewards, but also subsequent situations or states, and through those future rewards.
